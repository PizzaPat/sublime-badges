## Usage

All snippets start with the prefix `svg-` and `png-`, depending on which image format you want to use. The prefix is followed by the service you're adressing, with some services offering multiple choices.

Examples:

* `svg-pypi-dl-day` - daily downloads on PyPI
* `svg-pypi-dl-month` - monthy downloads on PyPI
* `svg-travis` - build status on Travis
* `svg-travis-branch` - build status on Travis for a specific branch
* `svg-npm-ver` - the version of a Node package
